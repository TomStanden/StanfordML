# StanfordML
Programming assignments for Andrew Ng's Coursera course on Machine Learning. Assignments completed in Octave.
Some of the code (mainly the visualisation of data and results) was provided by the course. 

Roughly the assingments tackled were:

Multivariable Linear regression to predict profits of a new foodtruck
Logistic regression to determine whether a student will get into his chosen university
Logistic regression and neural networks to recognize handwritten digits
Regularized linear regression and understanding bias vs variance
Support Vector Machines on 2D datasets and also as a spam classifier
K-means clustering on a standard dataset and also as a method of dimensionality reduction on a colour image
Anamoly detection for faulty servers and recommender systems to suggest suitable movies
